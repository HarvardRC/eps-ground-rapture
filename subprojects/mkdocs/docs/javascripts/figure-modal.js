/* Paper figures, opened in place.
 *
 * A page links to a figure like any other link:
 *
 *     [Figure 2](../figures.md#fig-2){ .figure-pop
 *       data-img="../../images/fig-02-scarp-classification.jpg"
 *       data-title="Figure 2 — the six scarp classes" }
 *
 * With JavaScript, clicking opens the image in a <dialog> so a reader
 * checking what a legend entry means does not lose their place on the
 * dashboard. Without it, the link simply navigates to the figure's section
 * on the Figures page — which is why the href is a real destination and not
 * a "#". Nothing here is required for the site to work.
 *
 * WHY THE LISTENER LOOKS LIKE THIS. Material's `navigation.instant` listens
 * for clicks on `document` and routes any same-site link itself. A handler
 * bound to the link runs later, in the bubble phase, so by the time it calls
 * preventDefault() the router has already started moving — preventDefault
 * cancels the browser's default navigation, not somebody else's programmatic
 * one, and the reader lands on the Figures page with no dialog. (The "How to
 * cite" modal never hit this because its triggers are <button>s, which the
 * router ignores.)
 *
 * So this is a single delegated listener on `window` in the CAPTURE phase.
 * Capture runs window → document → …, so it sees the click first, and
 * stopPropagation() keeps the event from ever reaching the router. Delegation
 * also means there is nothing to re-bind after an instant navigation.
 *
 * `data-img` is resolved by the browser against the current page, exactly
 * like the href, so both are written page-relative — note that a dashboard
 * page publishes to /dashboards/<name>/, two levels deep.
